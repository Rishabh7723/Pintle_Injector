This project focuses on the conceptual design and CFD analysis of a injector for a Methalox rocket engine.

The objective is to investigate injector performance characteristics under realistic operating conditions relevant to small reusable launch systems.
The study integrates:
Thermochemical performance analysis (NASA CEA)
Injector pressure drop optimization
Mixture ratio evaluation
Flow field simulation using CFD
Mixing and atomization behavior assessment

🎯 Design Configuration
Thrust Level: 1 kN
Chamber Pressure: 25 bar
Mixture Ratio (O/F): 2.7
Injector Pressure Drop: 20% of chamber pressure
Nozzle Expansion: Supersonic (Area Ratio = 50)
Flow Model: Equilibrium expansion
These parameters were selected to represent a realistic small reusable rocket engine.

🔬 Research Goals
Analyze injector flow stability under realistic pressure conditions
Evaluate the influence of pressure drop on atomization quality
Study velocity distribution and mixing characteristics
Examine injector scalability for reusable applications
Develop a geometry suitable for high-efficiency combustion

🧪 Methodology
1️⃣ Combustion Performance Analysis
NASA CEA was used to determine optimal mixture ratio and performance trends across pressure ranges.
2️⃣ Injector Design
Injector geometry was sized based on mass flow requirements and pressure drop criteria.
3️⃣ CFD Simulation
Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze:
Flow development
Shear interaction
Mixing efficiency
Velocity contours
Pressure distribution

📊 Key Findings
Optimal mixture ratio observed near O/F ≈ 2.7.
Performance gains diminish significantly beyond moderate chamber pressures.
A 20% injector pressure drop provides strong atomization while maintaining realistic pump requirements.
Flow behavior indicates stable mixing regime under selected operating conditions.
